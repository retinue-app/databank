Community data for Star Wars: Legion

## Usage

TBD.

## Contributing

This repository is intentionally structured to be easy to contribute to, even
for non-technical community members. All bits of the database of cards and
keywords are located in `data/` and are stored in (validated) `.json` files.

> **Tip**: [Mozilla][] and [SquareSpace][] have introductions to `JSON` files.
